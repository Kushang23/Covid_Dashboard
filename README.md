# Covid_Dashboard
Introduction

This project delves into the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Leveraging the robust capabilities of Microsoft SQL Server for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, the objective is to explore the dataset, identify regional disparities in infection rates, and conduct predictive analysis to forecast future trends

Methodology:

Employing Microsoft SQL Server, a series of queries are crafted to extract valuable insights from the COVID-19 dataset. These queries encompass diverse aspects, including total cases vs total deaths, infection rates vs population density, and identifying countries with the highest death count per population. Advanced SQL functionalities such as JOIN operations, Common Table Expressions (CTE), and temporary tables are utilized for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

Key Insights from SQL Queries:

Through total cases vs total deaths analysis, significant trends emerge regarding the severity of the pandemic in different regions.
By juxtaposing infection rates with population density, nuanced insights into the spread of the virus are uncovered, aiding in understanding the impact on densely populated areas.
Identification of countries with the highest death count per population sheds light on regions facing disproportionate challenges in managing the pandemic.
Breaking down data by continents facilitates a comprehensive understanding of regional variations in infection rates and mortality rates.
Delving deeper, users are presented with average overall ratings categorized by aircraft type, complemented by the corresponding number of reviews. This segment facilitates insights into passenger perceptions of different aircraft models and their overall satisfaction levels.
